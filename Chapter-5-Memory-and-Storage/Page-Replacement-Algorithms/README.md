 ![](./images/Page_replacement.gif)
 
The goal of this project is to implement the page replacement algorithms presented in Chapter 5.\
Besides implementing **First In First Out (FIFO)**, **Second Chance**, and **Least Recently Used** algorithms, this program also allows the user to: 
- Choose between those 3 algorithms;
- Visualize which frames have no assoicated pages;
- Select the page to be acessed;
- See the victim page based on the algorithm selected.

## Usage

- Run the program and select the algorithm you want the program to use
- Follow the instructions for each algorithm
